```

The coverage target of 70% was exceeded with a total coverage of 78.94% for the codebase. This includes:

- 100% coverage for controllers, middleware, and routes
- 88% line coverage for the vendor model
- 100% coverage of the in-memory database
- 100% coverage of the server

Some files have lower coverage due to them being placeholders for future implementation (such as seedDb.js and setupDb.js) or because they require an actual database connection to test properly (like db.js and parts of user.js).
